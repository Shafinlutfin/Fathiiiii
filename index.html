      <h2>🌷 1. For Being You</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes I look at you and wonder how someone can be so kind without even realizing it.
        You don’t try to be anyone you’re not—and that’s what makes you different.
        There’s something about you—steady and soft.
        It’s like quiet comfort, like coming home.
        
        You don’t just listen, you get it.
        You understand the words, and the feelings behind them.
        Even when I can’t find the words myself, you somehow know.
        I’ve never met anyone who sees me so clearly,
        and holds that with so much care.
        
        Thank you for loving me the way you do, for staying even when it’s hard,
        You’re a gift, in the kindest way.
        
        Just… thank you for being you.
        Nah no thanks...</p>

      <h2>Ordinary Days to speacial Days</h2>
      <p>The way you light up things when you talk about something you love.
        The little things—the small fights(pedi ind tta), those quick arguments—
        I just love them
        You turn regular moments into something special.
        
        And when you talk,
        you don’t just tell me stories,
        you make them come alive.
        You add all the little details,
        like you’re letting me live in that moment with you.
        
        But what stays with me most—
        is how you remember.
        The little things I’ve said, the things I might forget,
        you remember them.
        It makes me feel heard, really heard.
        Like I truly matter to you.</p>

      <h2>Luziii</h2>
      <p>
        There are days I forget the world can be kind—
        and then you remind me.
        You have this way of making everything feel lighter, warmer, softer.
        You don’t just make me happy.
        You make me feel safe being happy.
        You calm the storms inside me without even realizing it.
        
        When I’m tired, you notice.
        When I’m stressed, you don’t pull away—
        you come closer.
        You help me breathe again.
        
        You cheer me up in ways no one else can.
        Even on my worst days, just having you near feels like a gentle hand saying, “You’re okay now.”
        
        And the way you do it all—so naturally, without asking for anything—
        it makes me feel like I’m the luckiest person alive.
        
        That kind of love? That kind of presence?
        It’s everything.                                                                      luziiii</p>

      <h2>Your precious time</h2>
      <p>
        Time is the one thing we never get back.
        And still, you give yours so freely—
        sitting with me in silence,
        listening to my worries,
        holding space for all of me, even the messy parts.
        
        Even when you’re busy,
        even when you’re going through your own stuff—
        you still show up for me.
        You always find a way.
        
        Even without internet,
        you’ll go out of your way to make sure I don’t feel alone.
        That kind of effort? That kind of love?
        It’s more than I ever thought I’d have.
        
        You choose me, over and over.
        And I don’t take that for granted.</p>

      <h2>No Regrets</h2>
      <p>
        You put me first—not because you have to, but because it’s just who you are.
        You protect what we have.
        You fight for it in ways I notice, even if I don’t always say it.
        
        You argue with me when I joke about things that matter,
        like my health,
        because you care that much.
        You push me to take better care of myself,
        not because you have to,
        but because you want me to be okay.
        
        There’s no pretending with you.
        No games, no doubts—just steady care.
        When you stand up for me, even when I’m being stubborn or silly,
        I feel safe. I feel seen.
        I’ve never felt more sure, more chosen.</p>

      <h2>Diary?/Doctor?</h2>
      <p>
        I know not every day is light and easy.
        Sometimes everything feels loud and heavy all at once.
        But I want you to know this: I believe in you.
        Even when you're tired. Even when you doubt.
        And I’m here—for the quiet, the chaos, and everything in between.
        
        You give me space to breathe.
        When it all feels too much,
        I can just come to you,
        share my thoughts without fear of judgment.
        You make me feel like I can say anything.
        
        Even when you can’t fix everything,
        you make it your problem too,
        working with me, by my side,
        doing your best to make it easier.
        You’re not just my safe place;
        you’re my peace.</p>
